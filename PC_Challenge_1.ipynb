        "- groups are of 3 members at most, that should, for as much as possible, equally contribute to the project.\n",
        "- you automagically get ~3 points in the 1st part of the exam, taking the form of 1-2 questions that you will be allowed to skip.\n",
        "- deadline is 1 week (as of this writing, you will need to submit your work before october 23 at 23:59).\n",
        "- submissions are to be made on WeBeep, where you need to upload a downloaded copy of this notebook (.ipynb file); for groups of multiple people, it's enough for one member to submit the file in the assignment, other members shall simply write their group's name in their submission, we will then infer groups from what you write in the report section.\n",
        "- your code needs to work here on Colab with the T4 runtime.\n",
        "- do not alter code sections delimited by \"===\"s in the final submission.\n",
        "- we will change around matrix sizes arbitrarily while evaluating your work, so make sure to cover all edge cases and take care that your code is scalable (e.g. execution time grows as expected when doubling all dimensions).\n",
        "- you can get the maximum grade just by using what was discussed during lectures or is present in the glossary shown during exercise sessions; still, if you wanna have \"more fun\" this guide is your best friend https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-best-practices-guide.\n",
        "- a piece of code that works is better than a supposedly faster piece of code that doesn't, so don't go overboard, but be ambitious.\n",
        "- use LLMs (ChatGPT and friends) responsibly; the purpose of this challenge is for you to get your hands dirty and build up confidence in writing parallel code through trial and error. Having an LLM write your code may get you the challenge's points (unless it's so blatant that we notice), but won't lead you to learn anything and the next time you see some parallel code your mind goes blank. If you wack your head at the problem instead, and solve it, the solution will stick in the back of your mind for a long time. Similarly, if despite pushing yourself you can't find \"that damn bug\", then asking an LLM is fine, so long as you tried first by yourself and just say \"ahhhhhh, so that what it was!\" upon having the LLM help you out. Long story short, AI is fine so long as it's a tool you **learn from** and **not** one you **blindly lean on**.\n",
